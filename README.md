# IRC_Class_Project

This specification describes a simple Internet Relay Chat (IRC) protocol by which clients can communicate with each other. This system employs a central server which 'relays' messages that are sent to it to other connected users. Users can join rooms, which are groups of users that are subscribed to the same message stream. Any message sent to that room is forwarded to all users currently joined to that room. Users can also send private messages directly to other users.
